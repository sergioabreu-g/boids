# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

Before you even start doing anything, please make sure no one is doing it already!
You can do this by searching in issues or by asking directly to the project managers.
Then, we recommend you to follow the next guidelines when making a pull request.

1. Ensure all of the changes are related to your pull request, and you are not
   uploading temporary files/code by mistake.
2. Make sure your build is passing all tests and everything is working as intended.
3. Update the README.md and/or documentation of the project with the details of the
   changes you've made.
4. Make sure your pull request title and description are clear and concise about what your changes
   are fixing or implementing, and try to avoid clustering many different changes. It's better to do
   multiple pull request.

*And please be patient, saturating the project managers will only make the pull request process
slower.*
