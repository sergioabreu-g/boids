# Boids
In 1986 Craig Reynolds created an artificial life simulation called Boids, which
was able to closely imitate the behavior of flocks of birds. This is an implementation
of the Boids Algorithm made in Godot (v3.2.3).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

You only need [Godot v3.2.3](https://godotengine.org/download) or a compatible/higher version.

### Installing

Clone or download this repository and open the 'boids' project with Godot.

## Guide of use

This algorithm is an example of an emergent behavior. This means that the
behavior itself is not directly programmed, and rather shows up as a product of
the interaction between some simple elements. So, we only have to code a set of rules
every bird-oid object (*boid*) must follow, and then put them all together.

The main rules are cohesion, separation and alignment. You can find a more
in-depth explanation in [this video](https://youtu.be/pXQCasmBhY4) I made.

You can find 2 main scripts in the Godot project:

- **Flock**. This is responsible for spawning the flock and then making the
necessary calculations for each rule. This is done this way, instead of
each boid deciding by itself, to allow for a more efficient and manageable code,
since the flock script has access to all the boids.

- **Boid**. This script acts as a container that can be accessed from the flock
script. It's also responsible for updating the boid's position, rotation and
velocity using the acceleration calculated by the flock's script in each frame.
